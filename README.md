# Interloc

Interloc aims to solve inter-service interface validation. You can think of it like a language agnostic typechecker. This is the core tool, which only handles validation over an arbitrary format representing structural type systems. This format isn't meant to be hand-written (though there are plans to clean it up to make this easier), but instead to be generated from your source code via type reflection, compiler integrations, or language features.
